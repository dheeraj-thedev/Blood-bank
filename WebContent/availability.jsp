<p class="txt">
<p>Human blood is grouped into four types: A, B, AB, and O. Each
letter refers to a kind of antigen, or protein, on the surface of red
blood cells. For example, the surface of red blood cells in Type A blood
has antigens known as A-antigens.</p>
<h3><br/>The Rh Factor</h3><br/><hr/>
<p>Each blood type is also grouped by its Rhesus factor, or Rh
factor. Blood is either Rh positive (Rh+) or Rh negative (Rh-). About
85% of Americans have Rh+ blood.</p>
<p>Rhesus refers to another type of antigen, or protein, on the
surface of red blood cells. The name Rhesus comes from Rhesus monkeys,
in which the protein was discovered.</p>
<h3><br/>Blood Transfusions</h3><br/><hr/>
<p>Blood types become very important when a blood transfusion is
necessary. In a blood transfusion, a patient must receive a blood type
that is compatible with his or her own blood type&mdash;that is, the
donated blood must be accepted by the patient's own blood. If the blood
types are not compatible, red blood cells will clump together, making
clots that can block blood vessels and cause death.</p>
<p>Type O&#8211; blood is considered the &#8220;universal
donor&#8221; because it can be donated to people of any blood type. Type
AB+ blood is considered the &#8220;universal recipient&#8221; because
people with this type can receive any blood type.</p>

<h3><br/>Did You Know?</h3><br/><hr/>
Blood type is inherited, just like eye color.<br />
Certain blood types are more common in certain countries. In China, over
99% of the population has Rh+ blood.<br />
<br />
Different kinds of animals have different kinds of blood. Dogs have 4
blood types; cats have 11; cows have about 800.<br />
<br />
Some people think blood type tells about personality. Legend has it that
Type A is calm and trustworthy; Type B is creative and excitable; Type
AB is thoughtful and emotional; and Type O is a confident leader.<br />
<br />
In Japan, the idea of blood type as personality type is so popular that
Japanese ask &#8220;What's your blood type?&#8221; about as often as
Americans ask &#8220;What's your sign?&#8221;<br />
