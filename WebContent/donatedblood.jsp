<h2 class="heading colr">Components of Blood</h2>

<p class="txt" style="font-size: 15px"> 
When we receive your donation we separate it into individual components by spinning it in a machine called a centrifuge. The individual components are red cells, white cells, platelets and plasma. These can all be put to different uses.
</p>
<h3><br/>Red blood cells</h3><br/><hr/>
<br/><img src="images/b3.jpg"/><br/><br/>
<p class="txt" style="font-size: 15px"> 
The main function of red blood cells is to distribute oxygen to body tissues and to carry waste carbon dioxide back to the lungs.
Red cell transfusions are used to replace heavy blood loss (e.g. trauma, surgery, childbirth) or to correct severe anaemia when the bone marrow is not producing enough red cells (e.g. chemotherapy, leukaemia and thalassaemia). Anaemia is when your haemoglobin levels are lower than normal.
Red cells are filtered to remove the white blood cells and have a 35 day shelf life. Very rare blood groups can be frozen to be used at a later date, but this is not done commonly as it is an expensive and time-consuming process.

</p>
<h3><br/>White blood cells</h3><br/><hr/>
<br/><img src="images/b4.jpg"/><br/><br/>
<p class="txt" style="font-size: 15px"> 
Seen here are two lymphocyte left cells and one neutrophil right cell of the human immune system.
White blood cells fight infection and are part of the bodys defence system. White cell transfusions can be given to patients suffering from life-threatening infections whose normal defence mechanisms dont seem to be responding to antibiotics.

</p>
<h3><br/>Platelets</h3><br/><hr/>
<br/><img src="images/b2.jpg"/><br/><br/>
<p class="txt" style="font-size: 15px"> 
Platelets, or thrombocytes, are a constituent of the blood formed in the bone marrow.
<p class="txt" style="font-size: 15px">These tiny fragments of cells are crucial in helping your blood to clot. If your platelet level is very low then you may suffer a lot from bruising and bleeding.

<h3><br/>Plasma</h3><br/><hr/>

<p class="txt" style="font-size: 15px"> 
1.	Fresh frozen plasma is used after obstetric loss of blood (which is usually childbirth), during cardiac surgery, and to reverse any anti-coagulant treatment.<br/>
2.	Its also used to replace clotting factors after massive transfusions or when they are not being sufficiently produced, such as liver disease.<br/>
3.	And then there's processed plasma, which has several important uses.<br/>
4.	For instance, it is used in the treatment of haemophilia and for treating sufferers of Christmas disease, a life-threatening form of haemophilia.<br/>
5.	Processed plasma is also used to help produce stronger antibodies against diseases like tetanus, hepatitis, chickenpox and rabies.<br/>
6.	It also helps generate anti-D, which is used for RhD negative pregnant women carrying RhD positive babies.<br/>
7.	Additionally there is a protein called albumin contained in plasma, which is extremely beneficial for burn victims.<br/>
